Aryeh Naar - 13623044 - naar@student.uts.edu.au
Christopher Rayner Halim - 13730662 - ChristopherRayner.Halim-1@student.uts.edu.au

Contribution to project:
We decided to split the project evenly, each taking a set of controllers and focussing on their content and code
- Aryeh focussed on: Seats, tickets, and confirmation
- Rayner focussed on: home, movies, and time

Additionally, we split the presentation evenly each presenting our selected views
